By clicking on the name of each one you will
access more detailed information about it.

## Comparison

The following are some comparison tables about objective data. From there you can navigate to the
details of each technology or, in some cases, know about the differences for a particular category.

If there is some information that you would like to see in here, please open an issue in [GitHub].

### Platform support

Have a quick look at all the platforms supported by the different technologies.

{{ table technologies.{}.platforms }}

### Rendering strategies

As seen in the [Rendering strategies](rendering) section, there are 3 different ways of
"painting pixels". You can see what is the strategy for each one in the following table:

{{ table technologies.{}.rendering }}

### Language support

This table shows what are the "out-of-the-box" languages supported by a technology. A project using
one of these technologies could have parts of it created using another language and communicate each
other via some type of mechanism. Those scenarios are not contemplated in the following table.

{{ table technologies.{}.languages }}

### Source code license

This table compares the type of license the source of each project has.
It could be licensed under an [Open-source license] like Apache 2.0, MIT, etc. or be close and not
have access to it.
Some projects might be based in OSS project, the "extra code" might be close source. For those
cases the project is considered close source.
