# Why cross-platform development?

Users interact with a wide variety of devices: phones, tablets, computers... and they expect to have
access to the same applications. Making your application "universally available" is no longer a
feature, it is expected and it has a cost.

Development teams need to decide what is their best strategy to achieve this goal while continue
shipping new features, fixing bugs, etc. accross all the available versions. Using a cross-platform
technology is one of those strategies. While many think that cross-platform means "write once, run
everywhere", the reality is that there are many technologies. Some get you closer to this, at the
expense of other caracteristics (like memory, speed, UI flexibility), and vice-versa.
What is more, a cross-platform technology might not be the right solution for a given problem.
There are many alternatives, each with their pros and cons. It is important to know what are the
pros and cons of each one and when they apply.

The goal of this website is to provide this information so you can take more informed decissions
based on your requirements. This is a community effort, based on data, and not hype. Built in many
cases with the help of experts in those technologies. If there is anything that does not seem
accurate please do not hesitate to open an [issue]. And if there is something missing, please help
us and [complete it][add technology].
