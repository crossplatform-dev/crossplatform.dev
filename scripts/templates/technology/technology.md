## Release cadence, version support and update model

<!-- ✍ How often is there a new version? Is it predictable? Does it use an evergreen model (i.e.:
it gets updated automatically) or do developers need to take care of that? Does it depend on other
projects to ship? -->

## Governance

<!-- ✍ Please add an introductory paragraph about the governance model of the project: part of a
foundation, company driven, etc. -->
